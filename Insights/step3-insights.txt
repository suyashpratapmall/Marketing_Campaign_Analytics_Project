Top channels by attributed ROI (baseline):
- Facebook: attributed ROI = 5.03, attributed revenue = 338588877.94
- Website: attributed ROI = 5.01, attributed revenue = 349614199.13
- Google Ads: attributed ROI = 5.01, attributed revenue = 349922788.70
- YouTube: attributed ROI = 5.00, attributed revenue = 347855419.92
- Email: attributed ROI = 5.00, attributed revenue = 353847088.75

Recommendation rationale:
- Increase budget toward channels with above-average attributed ROI, but limit any single-channel change to +/-30% of its current spend in this first reallocation step.
- Run 4-week A/B tests after reallocating to validate impact on conversions and ROI.
